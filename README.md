 Form is created using bootstrap in components folder.
For all form inputs , variables are created using usestate() hook.
On change the input , respective handlers functions are being invoked of respective variable or input.
On submit , FormHandle function will invoked in which all the data of input can be access through all variables.
I have fetched a google sheet API where the data is being stored.
